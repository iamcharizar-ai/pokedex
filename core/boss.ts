// GAME CORE: the weekly boss (rules version 10). See BOSS-DESIGN.md.
//
// A boss is a week-long fight against a card of five tasks. This file is the
// shapes and the arithmetic only; the fold (fold.ts) keeps its state.
//
// The card and each day's progress are DECIDED OUTSIDE the core and written to
// the ledger (`boss_card`, `boss_day`), the way a day's habit list is: the
// Pokedex plans the card with the coaches and measures the week from the raw
// events, and both apps then fold the same numbers. So this file never needs
// to know what a workout or a guitar log is.
