// The whole game, as one pure function of the days so far.
//
// Nothing here is stored anywhere: partner, Box, collection, the wild Pokemon,
// the league and the Bag are recomputed from the day list every time, which is
// why two devices (and two apps) always show the same thing.
//
// A day's work does three different things:
//   how MUCH you did      → the partner's XP
//   how MANY habits you ticked → the wild Pokemon's HP (catching), and the ball it is thrown with
//   what KIND of work     → the gym leader's HP (the league)
// and a day with nothing ticked at all costs something small (see SLIP).
